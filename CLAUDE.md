# llzk-to-shlo

## Design Philosophy

llzk-to-shlo lowers [LLZK](https://github.com/project-llzk/llzk-lib) circuit IR
into [StableHLO](https://github.com/fractalyze/stablehlo) so that ZK witness
generation can ride on the same ML compiler infrastructure everyone else already
optimizes. The end of the pipeline is GPU execution through
[open-zkx](https://github.com/fractalyze/open-zkx)'s `stablehlo_runner`, which
gives batched witness generation a single kernel launch instead of one per
proof.

**Core principles:**

- **Reuse ML compiler infrastructure.** StableHLO is already a well-supported IR
  with GPU backends, fusion, and batching. Every design choice prefers
  expressing ZK primitives as StableHLO ops over rolling our own runtime.
- **Batch first.** Witness generation is embarrassingly parallel across proofs.
  Every lowering must survive a leading batch dimension being added by
  `BatchStablehlo`; per-op bridging rules live in
  [`docs/BATCH_STABLEHLO.md`](docs/BATCH_STABLEHLO.md).
- **GPU correctness is the gate.** LIT + unit tests prove IR shape; the real
  correctness signal is `batch[i] == single[i]` against circom's native C++
  witness on real circuits. `@constrain` is erased during lowering, so GPU code
  computes witnesses with no internal alarm — circom is the only catch for a
  miscompile.
- **Frontend-agnostic target.** LLZK is the stable contract; Circom is one
  producer. Do not leak Circom-specific assumptions into LlzkToStablehlo passes.

```

Two passes sit at the core:

- **SimplifySubComponents** removes pod dispatch patterns and flattens component
  calls into direct `function.call`, making the IR legible to the type-aware
  conversion pass that follows.
- **LlzkToStablehlo** is the heavy pass — it runs pre-passes (input-pod
  elimination, while-carry promotion, SSA-ification of `array.write`,
  `array.insert`, and `struct.writem`), the main partial conversion (LLZK op
  patterns → StableHLO), and post-passes (`scf.while` → `stablehlo.while`,
  `scf.if` → `stablehlo.select`, reconnecting `func.call` results to
  `pod.read @comp` consumers, residual LLZK cleanup, arith → stablehlo, DCE,
  while loop vectorization).

Three vectorization phases are applied after conversion — independent while
loops, 2D carry while, and nested-while inner loops. Benchmarks and the exact
rewrite shapes are in [`docs/BATCH_STABLEHLO.md`](docs/BATCH_STABLEHLO.md).

## Why the Pipeline Looks This Way

Four splits look arbitrary in code but exist because merging would break
correctness:

- **Pod dispatch elimination is mandatory, not optional cleanup.** A single
  Circom `lt.in[0] <== v1; lt.in[1] <== v2` compiles to ~40 lines of LLZK state
  machine (input-counter + `!pod.type<[...]>` pending-inputs record + delayed
  `function.call`). Conversion patterns can't reliably match across this
  boilerplate, so `SimplifySubComponents` must flatten it first.
- **`SimplifySubComponents` runs to a fixed point because component nesting is
  arbitrary.** Each pod layer must be peeled before the next becomes
  pattern-matchable. Phases that early-return for internal-state safety (e.g.
  `unpackPodWhileCarry` — pointer invalidation when its inner SmallVector
  contains a chained-while it erased inline) need their own inner
  `while (phase(block))` loop at the driver site if a *same-iteration* later
  phase consumes their complete output. The outer fixed point is too coarse:
  with N independent candidates only the first gets processed before destructive
  later phases (`eliminatePodDispatch` Phase 5) run.
- **While-loop transformation is four phases because LLZK is mutable, StableHLO
  is SSA, and loop bodies can mutate outer arrays.** `array.write %outer[%i]`
  inside `scf.while` must flow through carry tuples to lower to a functional
  `stablehlo.while`. The phase ordering (array-to-carry promotion → SSA-ify
  writes → main conversion → `scf.while → stablehlo.while`) is forced. The
  shared walker `processBlockForArrayMutations` is reused with different
  `latest` trackers per pre-pass — it MUST gate mutating ops on the target being
  currently tracked, or untracked writes get rewritten orphan and silently
  DCE'd.
- **Post-passes exist because `applyPartialConversion` does 1:1 op replacement,
  not region restructuring.** Rewriting `scf.while` → `stablehlo.while`,
  reconnecting `func.call` results to `pod.read @comp` consumers, and
  vectorizing independent while loops all move/delete regions — partial
  conversion can't express that.

## LLZK as a Moving Contract

LLZK is versioned upstream and changes break us. Each rule below is a
silent-miscompile or hang trap; for already-landed fixes, git blame +
`~/.claude/knowledge/llzk-to-shlo-*.md` carry the implementation history.

- **Test fixtures are consumer-owned IR.** Hand-written `.mlir` test files get
  parsed directly. The upstream IR migrator does not touch parser input —
  consumer fixtures must be hand-migrated in the same bump.
- **BUILD glue must move with upstream.** New `.td` files (new dialects /
  interfaces) don't appear in `third_party/llzk/llzk.BUILD` automatically. When
  bumping, diff `include/llzk/Dialect/**/*.td` against `gentbl_cc_library`
  targets and add missing inc-gen rules.
- **`createEmptyTemplateRemoval` uses `applyFullConversion` over a narrow op
  list.** Its conversion target only handles ops in `OpClassesWithStructTypes`
  (struct/array/function/global/constrain/polymorphic). Anything else (`pod.*`,
  `llzk.nondet` results with struct types, our synthesized ops) MUST be gone or
  already in stripped form before this pass. Order: clean residual pod traffic
  first, pre-strip `<[]>` only on ops *outside* that tuple, then run template
  removal.
- **project-llzk/circom PR #378's same-named `poly.template` wrap leaves
  `module @X { function.def @X }` shells after `EmptyTemplateRemoval`.** circom
  v2 (post-#378) emits every `function.def` / `struct.def` inside a same-named
  `poly.template @X` to track polymorphic typing. `EmptyTemplateRemoval`
  rewrites that to `builtin.module @X { function.def @X }`; the inner symbol now
  shadows the wrapping module's symbol in the parent's `SymbolTable`, and the
  next pass that walks it (LlzkToStablehlo conversion in particular) trips with
  `redefinition of symbol named '<X>'`. Fix surface is
  `flattenSingleEntityWrapperModules` in `SimplifySubComponents.cpp`: hoist the
  same-named single child to module level, erase the empty wrapper, then use
  `AttrTypeReplacer` to rewrite `@X::@X[::@method]` → `@X[::@method]` so refs
  nested in types (e.g. `!struct.type<@X::@X>`) are also caught — a plain
  attribute walk misses those.
- **`<[]>` (empty params) vs no params on `!struct.type`.** Template removal
  rewrites `<[]>` to no-params on covered ops but leaves SSA values on uncovered
  ops alone. Mixing forms across a use-def edge produces unresolved
  `builtin.unrealized_conversion_cast`. Strip on uncovered ops; don't strip on
  covered ones.
- **`llzk.nondet : index` is dialect-conversion-illegal.** The conversion target
  legalizes nondet for felt/array/struct only. For residual `pod.read` ops with
  `index` result type (dispatch-pod `@count` countdown), substitute
  `arith.constant 0 : index` — the surrounding cmpi/scf.if scaffold is
  structurally dead once the call is hoisted; 0 keeps cmpi false and DCE
  collapses the dead branch.
- **`replaceRemainingPodOps` (Phase 5) clobbers `unpackPodWhileCarry`'s field
  discovery.** Phase 5 nondets every `pod.read` in a block — including reads of
  pod-typed `scf.while` block args, which are field-discovery input for the next
  outer iteration. Gate `eliminatePodDispatch` on the block having no pod-typed
  block args. Symptom: multi-record input pods (e.g. keccak
  `<[@a: array, @b: array]>` carries) survive into dialect conversion.
- **Pod-array iter-arg survival post-simplify is a silent miscompile signal.**
  Diagnostic:
  `bazel run //tools:llzk-to-shlo-opt -- --simplify-sub-components <input>` then
  `grep -nE "scf.while.*x !pod"`. Any surviving pod-typed `scf.while` carry
  means `flattenPodArrayWhileCarry` skipped that loop. Downstream Phase 5
  nondets the cross-iteration `pod.read [@a]`, the resulting
  `function.call @<Sub>::@compute(%nondet, %nondet)` lowers to `XOR(0,0) = 0`,
  and the parent struct.member's witness slot fills with zeros. Pair with the
  lowered StableHLO grep `func.call @<Sub>_<Sub>_compute(%cst.*=0` — both should
  be empty for a cleanly-flattened circuit.
- **Multi-carry chips need rewrite-back between consecutive same-instance
  compute calls.** Chips holding multiple input pod-arrays alive across N+ outer
  iterations of `SimplifySubComponents` (canonical case `maci_splicer` with 4
  input pod-arrays) emit 2 compute calls per loop iter (one per `<==` input
  write); without a `dynamic_update_slice %iterArg` between calls, the 2nd call
  reads `[0, latest_write]` instead of `[1st_write, 2nd_write]`. Sister
  single-carry chips (`maci_quin_selector`) emit the rewrite-back natively.
  Diagnostics (BOTH must be 0):
  `grep -cE 'func.call @<Sub>_.*compute\(%cst' <chip>.stablehlo.mlir` (blanket
  nondet of load-bearing `pod.read [@in]`); and
  `grep -nE 'dynamic_update_slice %iterArg_<input-pod-shaped-args>'`
  (accumulator never rewired — runtime bug even when the first metric is clean).
  Structural fix surface lives in three coupled callsites:
  `eraseDeadPodAndCountOps` (guard rewrite-back chain across phases),
  `flattenPodArrayWhileCarry` (resort `fieldOrder` to record-declaration order),
  and the post-`runOnOperation` rewire (contiguous-mixed-type pre-pass before
  homogeneous-sub-run match).
- **`llzk.nondet` dispatch pod (no `pod.new`) is a silent miscompile.** Earlier
  circom-llzk emits `pod.new {@count = const_N}`; post project-llzk/circom PR
  #390 the same pod can come in as
  `llzk.nondet : !pod.type<[@count: index, ...]>`. Inside the input-collection
  scf.while, `pod.read [@count]` yields garbage, the buried
  `function.call @<Sub>::@compute(...)` never fires, and `@main` fills with
  const-0. Diagnostic: post-`--simplify-sub-components` lowered StableHLO
  `@main` body of only `stablehlo.constant ... 0` + reshapes +
  dynamic_update_slice with no `func.call` ⇒ dispatch elimination silently
  dropped the call. `materializeScalarPodCompField`'s candidate filter must
  include `llzk.nondet` alongside `pod.new`.
- **Writerless `llzk.nondet` dispatch pod ⇒ synthesize zero-arg substruct
  call.** Subset of the above with no `pod.write %pod[@comp] = ...` anywhere
  (circom dropped the inline call for constant-table sub-components, e.g.
  keccak's `RC_0`). `materializeScalarPodCompField` bails on `writers.empty()`.
  Walk the @comp struct ref + `@compute`, look up the `function.def` via
  `SymbolTable::lookupSymbolIn(module, callee)`, and synthesize a function-scope
  `function.call @<Sub>::@compute()` only when `getNumInputs() == 0`. Use
  `getTopLevelModule` to walk past LLZK v2's per-component `builtin.module`
  wrappers.
- **`APInt::getSExtValue()` on a felt constant is a silent miscompile.** UB at
  `getBitWidth() > 64` — the call returns the low 64 bits. `1 << 252` (LessThan
  offset) truncates to `0`. Use `APInt::zextOrTrunc(storageWidth)` —
  zero-extension is correct because field elements are unsigned, ranged `[0, p)`
  with `p < 2^254`. Diagnostic: `grep "value = dense<" | grep -v "dense<[0-9]>"`
  — bn128 felt circuits with comparators MUST emit at least one
  `dense<7237005577332262213973186563042994240829374041602535252466099000494570602496>`
  (= 2^252) per `LessThan`. Sister site to audit: `convertToIndexTensor` in
  `TypeConversion.cpp`.
- **`APInt::operator==` / `!=` asserts on bit-width mismatch — normalize at
  construction when collecting APInts from heterogeneous sources.**
  `felt.const`'s `FeltConstAttr` uses `APIntParameter`'s minimum-bits-needed
  sizing (e.g. `felt.const 1` → 4-bit APInt); `arith.constant : index` is always
  64-bit. Comparing them directly asserts in dbg and is UB in opt (slow-case
  `EqualSlowCase` reads past one side's word boundary, often producing a corrupt
  pointer that segfaults much later — the original bucket-2 S1-cluster
  `Type::getContext` UAF inside `EmptyTemplateRemoval` was a downstream symptom
  of this). When building a `SmallVector<APInt>` for comparison across sources,
  apply `zextOrTrunc(kCommonWidth)` at the push_back sites (typically 64 for
  index-typed values). Reference site:
  `SimplifySubComponents.cpp::outerIndexConstValues`.
- **`unpackPodWhileCarry` gates on a fixed set of handleable pod-value use
  shapes.** The expansion rewires pod.read/pod.write uses + the body terminator
  at the expand slot + post-while `pod.read`/`pod.write`/ `struct.writem` users
  \+ immediate chained `scf.while` users. Any other use (nested `scf.yield`
  carrying the pod up through enclosing whiles, function.call operand, scf.if
  branch yield) survives the rewires and trips `use_empty()` at the subsequent
  `eraseArgument` / `op.erase()`. Gate via use-shape check before any IR
  mutation; if any use is outside the handleable set, `continue` and let the
  outer fixed point retry. Apply the same gate to chained whiles with
  `allowChained=false` — chained-of-chained scf.whiles aren't handled by the
  branch.
- **`processNested` only recurses into scf.while regions, NOT scf.if.**
  `flattenPodArrayWhileCarry(block)` itself is non-recursive
  (`for (Operation &op : block)`). Pod-array-carrying `scf.while` buried inside
  an `scf.if` branch is invisible. Reach them with a post-main-loop straggler
  pass using `module.walk(scf::WhileOp)` — don't add scf.if recursion to
  `processNested`, that path also runs `eliminatePodDispatch`, whose pod
  block-arg gating assumes scf.while semantics.
- **Structural IR cleanup ≠ runtime fix on its own.** Closing the iter-arg chain
  at SimplifySubComponents (lowered `func.call (%cst, %cst)` count → 0) is
  necessary but NOT sufficient. Always re-run the GPU correctness gate AFTER
  each structural improvement. When structural metrics improve without a runtime
  delta, the data-flow disconnect is downstream — typically LlzkToStablehlo main
  conversion, the 3 vectorization phases, or BatchStablehlo.
- **A new SimplifySubComponents transform must converge with
  `eliminatePodDispatch`.** The outer `while (changed)` re-runs all phases plus
  `processNested` until no pass returns `true`. If your transform produces IR
  that `eliminatePodDispatch` keeps re-modifying every iteration, the loop never
  settles. Symptom: unit tests pass on toy IR but CI hangs for tens of minutes
  on real circuits. Diagnostic: wrap the outer loop with an iter counter + abort
  \> 50, log each phase's `changed` per iter — the phase still returning `1`
  after the others settle is the broken one. Emit IR that's idempotent under all
  five `eliminatePodDispatch` phases (extract calls / replace reads / erase
  writem / erase dead pods / replace remaining), or rely on the existing outer
  fixed-point + `processNested` to revisit nested constructs across iterations
  rather than recursing inside your own helper.
- **Result-bearing `scf.if` with tracked-array result slots + `%nondet_*` branch
  yields breaks the carry chain.** LLZK's `<--` produces scf.ifs whose array
  result slots get yielded as `llzk.nondet` placeholders in both branches; the
  actual writes happen via inner whiles inside each branch using the parent's
  tracked carry as init. After applyPartialConversion the nondet arrays become
  const-zero tensors; selects over them pick between two const-zero tensors.
  `liftScfIfWithArrayWrites` early-returns on `getNumResults() != 0` and handles
  void ifs only — result-bearing ifs go through
  `extendResultBearingScfIfArrayChain`, which must append NEW tail result slots
  typed `!array<x !felt>` (matching tracked-key types) — do NOT rewrite existing
  slots (the original `!array<x !pod>` placeholders and tracked
  `!array<x !felt>` carriers aren't type-equal pre-conversion). Idempotent
  across the dual-walker invocations (`convertArrayWritesToSSA` +
  `convertWhileBodyArgsToSSA`). Reuse path must reference `newIf.getResult(i)`
  not `oldIf.getResult(i)` — `oldIf` gets erased on append.
- **Don't reshape the `<--` cascade from SSC — downstream rewriters depend on
  its shape.** Tempting fix for orphan `pod.new : <[]>` survival: walk `scf.if`
  / `scf.execute_region` ops post-Phase-5 nondet, drop pod-typed result slots,
  and replace dropped uses with `llzk.nondet`. This converges cleanly inside SSC
  and yields well-formed IR, but trips `--llzk-to-stablehlo`'s scf.if rewriters
  at unrelated locations (`empty block: expect at least a terminator` on
  adjacent non-pod scf.execute_region); fully erasing all-pod scf.ifs hangs the
  conversion. The cascade carries values that
  `extendResultBearingScfIfArrayChain` / `convertArrayWritesToSSA` consume
  during their tracked-array shape match — any upstream reshape breaks the
  type-equality invariants they rely on. If a pod dispatch bundle is
  structurally dead, recognize it via use-trace at the scf.while-carrier drop
  decision instead — don't restructure the scf.if/ scf.execute_region
  scaffolding.
- **`eraseDeadPodAndCountOps` Phase 4 must walk regions transitively before
  erasing a region-bearing candidate.** `isAllResultsUnused(op)` is necessary
  but NOT sufficient when `op` carries inner ops whose results are consumed by
  users OUTSIDE `op`. Phase 1 (`extractCallsFromScfIf`) can hoist a
  `function.call` BEFORE an enclosing scf.if using `directArgs` (operands that
  aren't `pod.read`) — those direct args may be defined inside the scf.if body
  (e.g. `array.read %arr[%idx]` against an outer-scoped array). The hoisted call
  is then an external user of an inner-scf.if value. Phase 4 sees the scf.if's
  own result unused (Phase 2 RAUWd its pod-typed yield away), region- clears it,
  and trips `~Operation: operation destroyed but still has uses` during the
  inner producer's destruction. Gate via `isOpAndNestedResultsExternallyUnused`
  (walks each region, checks every inner op's result-users are inside `op` via
  `Operation::isAncestor`).
- **`extractCallsFromScfIf` Phase 1's directArgs path is non-idempotent — guard
  the hoist against inside-scf.if defs.** When the inner call's operands aren't
  `pod.read` (so `inputPodFields` is empty and `hasDirectArgs` fires), Phase 1
  builds the hoisted call with operands taken directly from the inner call. If
  any direct arg is defined INSIDE the scf.if's regions, the hoisted call sits
  outside but references inner SSA — invalid use that Phase 4 normally cleans up
  by erasing the scf.if. With the `isOpAndNestedResultsExternallyUnused` gate
  above blocking the erase, the scf.if survives — and Phase 1's next outer
  fixed-point iter sees the same scf.if + inner function.call and re-hoists a
  duplicate (~50+ duplicates per spin-out chip on `maci_*`). Skip the hoist when
  any directArg's defining op is inside `op` via `Operation::isAncestor`. The
  dispatch stays unflattened for this scf.if, but the pass converges.
- **`inlineInputPodCarries` must dedupe `toErase` — pod.write users span
  multiple podValues.** A single `pod.write %pod = %value` is a user of BOTH
  `%pod` (operand 0) and `%value` (operand 1) when both are pod-typed and traced
  into `podValues` via scf.while carry walks. The naive
  `toErase.push_back(user)` accumulation pushes the same pod.write twice, and
  the trailing `op->erase()` loop double-frees on the second visit
  (heap-use-after-free at `Operation::getBlock()`). Maintain a parallel
  `DenseSet<Operation*>` and add via a helper that no-ops on duplicates. Same
  bug surface for `pod.read` users in the (less common) shape where a pod.read
  appears in two podValues' use lists.
- **`convertWhileBodyArgsToSSA` (LlzkToStablehlo.cpp:823-855) absorbs
  forwarder-vs-nested-result yield discrepancies at lowering time.** It walks
  each scf.while body, runs `processBlockForArrayMutations` to track per-block
  latest SSA carriers (lines 491-509 rebind `latest[blockArg]` to the inner
  scf.while's matching result), then rewrites the body's yield
  operand-by-operand using `latest`. So an LLZK body yielding `%arg_blockarg`
  (forwarder shape) and an LLZK body yielding `%nested_while.result(_)`
  (nested-result shape) lower to the same StableHLO. Verify any LLZK-level
  yield-shape fix by diffing the lowered StableHLO, not the simplified LLZK —
  the LLZK may change while the lowered MLIR is identical, meaning the fix
  didn't earn its keep. Concrete fix sites for body-yield correctness are this
  pass and `processBlockForArrayMutations`, not `expandPodArrayWhile`'s yield
  rewriter.
- **`collapseRedundantWhileCarrierPairs` zero-init transitivity also requires
  every enclosing while to be passthrough.** The pass classifies a
  `stablehlo.while` slot as DEAD when its yield is a literal pass-through of the
  body argument and its init traces back through enclosing-while body-args to a
  zero-splat constant — then RAUWs the dead result with a sibling LIVE result of
  identical type. The DEAD-collapse semantics depend on the dead slot being
  "always zero on every iteration", which holds at THIS while only if no
  intermediate enclosing while mutates the carrier. A parent while whose yield
  differs from its body arg at the same slot index breaks this — body args on
  later iterations carry the parent's mutated value, not init. Canonical
  violator: AES `xor_2[i][j][k].b` is zero-initialized at the main while but
  actively written across rounds, so any inner-level passthrough isn't truly
  "always zero." `isZeroSplatTransitively` MUST reject the trace whenever a
  visited parent slot is non-passthrough — otherwise the inner RAUW silently
  merges `xor_2 .a` and `xor_2 .b` and the lowered body yields the same SSA
  value at distinct .a/.b slots.
- **`materializePodArrayCompField`'s drain materialization treats K pub felt
  members as an extra outer dim, NOT as separate `struct.member`s.** When a
  dispatched sub-component struct exposes K>1 `{llzk.pub}` felt members
  (Switcher's `@outL/@outR`, BitElementMulAny's `@dblOut/@addOut`), the parent's
  `struct.member @F' : <D x !struct>` flips to `<D, K x ...inner>` (one extra K
  dim prepended in declaration order — same shape circom's `.wtns` emits per
  chip iteration, contiguous `[f0_i, f1_i, …]` per cell). The K=1 path stays
  byte-identical to the original single-pub layout so AES sister chips never
  observe the change. Two implementation invariants that bite if broken: (1) K>1
  requires uniform inner type across all pub fields — mixed (e.g. one scalar +
  one `<M x !felt>`) needs a flat-felt concat path that no bucket-1 chip
  exhibits today; (2) `@constrain` must be repaired in lockstep — the
  `array.read %parent[%i]` becomes an `array.extract` of the `<K x ...>` slice
  and each per-pub `struct.readm @<f_j>` consumer gets rewritten to
  `array.read|extract %slice[%c_j]` using the field's declaration-order index,
  otherwise the next-pass partial conversion trips on a struct-typed operand
  into an erased `Sub::@constrain` callee. Sister gap: this only fixes drains
  where the inner struct has at least one pub felt member — webb
  `@ManyMerkleProof_275` (zero pub felts) still leaks through and blocks the
  16-instance variants of the webb chips at the next outer-level `@inTree`
  drain.

See [`docs/CIRCUIT_COVERAGE.md`](docs/CIRCUIT_COVERAGE.md) for how a
frontend/LLZK mismatch surfaces at the user-visible level (per-circuit
pass/fail, per-stage error categories).

## Load-Bearing Invariants

Cross-cutting assumptions the pipeline relies on. Each can be violated by an
innocent-looking change without breaking the build — the result still compiles,
runs on GPU, and silently produces wrong witnesses. Test changes in the
neighborhood against circom's C++ witness, not against the lowered IR alone.

- **Sister-circuit families (AES variants, SHA variants, etc.) are NOT
  differential references for each other.** Treating one as "the working one"
  because it diverges from a known-broken sibling is unsound — both can be
  silently broken in different output positions. Always pin the reference
  against an independent backend (circom `.wtns` via the m3 correctness gate)
  before treating it as ground truth.
- **Circom's `<==` vs `<--` is a security boundary.** `<==` emits both
  `@compute` and `@constrain`. `<--` emits only `@compute` and *requires* a
  separate explicit constraint (e.g. `Num2Bits` must add
  `out[i] * (out[i] - 1) === 0` after `out[i] <-- (in >> i) & 1`). Dropping the
  follow-up constraint does not fail any test in this repo — it just makes the
  circuit unsound in the prover.
- **`@constrain` functions and all `constrain.eq` ops are erased during
  lowering.** GPU code only runs witness generation; constraint satisfaction is
  the prover's job downstream. The lowered StableHLO has no way to catch a
  broken constraint.
- **Batched witness output must include every signal — public outputs *and*
  private internals.** `BatchStablehlo`'s leading `N` dim aliases the full
  per-witness state across `N` proofs. Pruning to "just the public signals"
  silently misaligns the batch axis.
- **Circom while loops have compile-time trip counts; all batch elements iterate
  the same number of times.** `BatchStablehlo` extracts the predicate from
  element `[0]` and reuses it for the whole batch. A future frontend emitting
  batch-divergent trip counts would break this.
- **Circom signals are immutable, which is what makes vectorization sound.**
  Auto-vectorization turns `while (i<N) { out[i] = f(a[i]) }` into `out = f(a)`
  only because `out[i]` can't be reassigned — the canonical iterative pattern is
  `chain[N][K+1]`-style arrays, not mutable accumulators.
- **`array.new` (no operands) and `llzk.nondet` lower to the same `dense<0>`
  constant.** `ArrayPatterns.cpp:ArrayNewPattern` and
  `RemovalPatterns.cpp:LlzkNonDetPattern` both call
  `tc.createConstantAttr(tensorType, 0, rewriter)`. Switching one for the other
  in `SimplifySubComponents` is a no-op at lowering time. Before chasing a
  refactor on "orphan nondet" or "wrong init source", verify the lowered
  StableHLO is actually different (run the gate, observe whether bytes flip). If
  not, the bug is downstream — likely in witness-output assembly.
- **Witness-output orphan-wire detection runs by default
  (`flag-orphan-zero-writes=true`).** The assertion in
  `StructPatterns.cpp:StructWriteMPattern::matchAndRewrite` aborts conversion
  when a `struct.writem`'s value resolves (through `lookThroughCast` +
  `stablehlo::ReshapeOp` + `stablehlo::ConvertOp`) to a splat-zero
  `stablehlo::ConstantOp` of length >= 8. Opt out for diagnostic spelunking with
  `flag-orphan-zero-writes=false`.
- **`--witness-layout-anchor` MUST run after `--simplify-sub-components`.**

## Conventions & Background

### M3 fixture convention

The M3 measurement harness (`bench/m3/`) feeds the SAME JSON fixture to both
`gpu_zkx` (`m3_runner --input_json=...`) and `cpu_circom` (the circom witness
binary in `run_baseline.sh`). Schema is circom's native form:
`{<signal_name>: scalar | flat-array}`, one top-level key per circuit input
signal. Fixtures live at `bench/m3/inputs/<TARGET>.json` where `<TARGET>`
matches the bazel alias in `bench/m3/run.sh`.

GPU-side parameter mapping is **positional in JSON insertion order** — MLIR
lowering strips circom signal names (parameters surface as `%arg0`, `%arg1`, …).
`bench/m3/json_input.cc` uses `nlohmann::ordered_json` (NOT plain
`nlohmann::json`, which iterates alphabetically) to preserve order; the
`KeyOrderMatters` test pins the contract. When adding a new circuit fixture,
JSON key order must match the order of `func.func @main`'s parameters in the
lowered StableHLO output (see `bazel-bin/examples/<TARGET>.stablehlo.mlir`).

Fixtures store **one witness's worth of values**, not N copies. `m3_runner`
auto-tiles per-witness tokens across the leading batch dim added by
`--batch-stablehlo`: `LiteralFromDecStrings` accepts
`tokens.size() * shape.dimensions(0) == num_elements` and replicates via
`tokens[i % token_count]`. So a fixture's `in[1600]` array fills
`tensor<N, 1600>` at any N≥1 without fixture changes.

`stablehlo_runner_main.cc`'s `ParseInputLiteral` / `ParseInputLiteralsFromJson`
are private to that binary's anonymous namespace; we cannot reuse them via
include and have ported the equivalents into `bench/m3/json_input.cc`. Don't
chase a "share the helper" refactor.

### M3 correctness gate convention

The `bench/m3/` gate opts in per-circuit via a
`bench/m3/inputs/<TARGET>.json.gate` sentinel. Sentinel content is the `.wtns`
wire-index list (one per output Literal element, space- or comma-separated); an
empty file defaults to contiguous `[1..1+N)`. `m3_runner` reads the index list
through `--gate_wtns_indices=...` and byte-compares the GPU output Literal
against `wtns.Witness(idx)` for each declared index.

**Layout caveat**: circom does NOT always assign wire IDs as
`[const, outputs, inputs, intermediates]`. `MontgomeryDouble`'s `.wtns`
interleaves outputs around echoed-input wires, so its sentinel is `1 2 5 6`. For
each new gated circuit, decode the `.wtns` integers to confirm input wire
positions (echoed inputs match the JSON fixture's values verbatim) — or run the
gate with provisional indices and read the mismatch-hex-diff.

`witness_compare`'s API accepts duplicate indices, required for circuits whose
GPU output flattens public + private intermediate signals into one tensor (e.g.
`keccak_pad` emits `tensor<2176>` = `out[1088] || out2[1088]`). When `@main`
reduces to `dynamic_update_slice(zeros<N>, %result<M>, 0)` with M < N, assign
each trailing pad position any `.wtns` index whose value decodes to 0.

The gate rejects tuple shapes / N>1 batched outputs; it is N=1 single-tensor
only. `run.sh` auto-skips at N>1 with an actionable message.

**Constraint-only templates lower to `tensor<0>` — gateable as shape-stability
anchors via vacuous PASS.** `witness_compare` early-returns OkStatus when
`num_elements == 0`, so a chip with no public signals can still be gated with an
empty `.json.gate`; a future regression that turns the output into `tensor<N>`
with N>0 surfaces at the existing element-count != index-count check.

**Every newly gated circuit must be added to the CI regression test in the same
PR that lands the fixture.** `//bench/m3:m3_correctness_gate_test` (`gpu`-tagged
`sh_test`) runs `m3_runner --correctness_gate=true` against each chip in its
`data` block. (1) Extend `CHIPS=(...)` in
`bench/m3/m3_correctness_gate_test.sh`, (2) append the matching
`//examples:<chip>` target plus the `.json` / `.json.gate` / `.wtns` trio to
`data = [...]` in `bench/m3/BUILD.bazel`. Skip ⇒ the gate is a
manual-checkpoint-only artifact.

**Circom binary swaps don't invalidate bazel's cache.**
`third_party/circom/workspace.bzl` writes a wrapper `exec`-ing the resolved
circom path. Bazel hashes the wrapper text, not binary content. Updating
`/usr/local/bin/circom` without changing the path string leaves wrapper text
identical → all downstream `circom_to_llzk`, stablehlo conversion, and
`m3_correctness_gate_test` outputs cache-hit. Symptom:
`m3_correctness_gate_test (cached) PASSED in <past time>`. Local invalidation:
`--disk_cache=` or `--repo_env=CIRCOM_PATH=/usr/local/./bin/circom` (path
perturbation forces repository_rule re-eval).

**Don't ship a gate sentinel before its baseline is currently green.** A new
`.json.gate` whose byte-equal compare fails at landing buys zero regression
protection. Bundle the sentinel + `data=[...]` + `CHIPS` updates into the same
PR as the lowering / compute fix that flips the metric red → green.

**`circom_to_llzk` passes `--stabilize` so multi-sub-component composite chips
have deterministic `struct.member` ordering.** Without the flag,
project-llzk/circom seeds its symbol-table / sub-component registry from a
default Rust `HashMap` `RandomState`, so any chip whose main `struct.def`
declares ≥2 sub-component-derived members shuffles output ordering per process
(proven 2026-05-04: 3 fresh runs, 3 distinct LLZK md5s on `splicer_test`).
Position-based `.json.gate` sentinels map GPU output offsets to `.wtns` wire
indices via that ordering, so non-deterministic emission would drift the gate
every CI run. `--stabilize` sorts the iteration order into something
reproducible — `splicer_test.llzk` md5 is byte-stable across runs once enabled.
Single-output chips (`@out` only) are immune either way. Keep the flag pinned in
`examples/e2e.bzl::_circom_to_llzk_impl`; dropping it returns the gate to its
drifting state.

Methodology trap: `bazel clean --expunge` does NOT wipe `--disk_cache=PATH`
configured in user-level `~/.bazelrc`; pass `--disk_cache=` (empty) when probing
for variance, otherwise the second run cache-hits the first.

### Markdown footnotes in docs/

The pre-commit `mdformat` hook runs with `mdformat-gfm` and
`mdformat-frontmatter` only — **no** `mdformat-footnote`. Raw GFM footnote
definitions (`[^id]: text`) are escaped to `\[^id\]: text` on autoformat. Use
**inline numeric markers** (`¹` `²` …) and a "Notes:" sub-list immediately under
the table. To switch styles, add `mdformat-footnote` to
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` `mdformat` `additional_dependencies` first.
